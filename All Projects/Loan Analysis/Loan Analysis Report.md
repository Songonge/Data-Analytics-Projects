## Introduction
This project is a hands-on training experience to build powerful business use cases using Amazon Q in QuickSight in the context of pseudo imaginary use case of the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA). The HMDA requires financial institutions to maintain, report, and publicly disclose loan-level information about mortgages.  This project examines trends in the loan domain to shed light on the debt challenges facing many consumers. By analyzing lending patterns across different locations and credit profiles, it aims to identify opportunities for more affordable options that can help ease financial burdens and set citizens up for long-term prosperity.

## Objective
Provide an overview of residential mortgage lending in 2022 based on the data collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA).
The report summarizes: 
*	Mortgage applications and originations, characteristics of home loans originated.
*	Denial rates of mortgage applications in 2022.
*	Monthly trends and activities of the mortgage market in 2022 including total applications.
*	Trends in interest rates and their impact on payment burdens
*	Breakdown of lending institutions that reported data under the HMDA in 2022 and their market shares.

## Data Acquisition and Preparation
Data were collected under the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act (HMDA) and provided by AWS. This dataset was already cleaned and had 14 columns in total.

## Data Processing
The tool I used to perform the analysis was Amazon Q in Amazon QuickSight. That is because Amazon Q in Amazon QuickSight enhances business productivity using Generative BI capabilities to accelerate decision-making. It also allows delivering easy-to-understand insights to your colleagues, no matter where they are. Moreover, it combines different data sources into one analysis and publishes/shares it as a dashboard.
*	To begin with, the Amazon Q application was created and Amazon Q in QuickSight was configured. 
*	Then the dataset was added by uploading the Sample_Top_Respondents file (previously downloaded).

<br/>

  * Total loan amounts across all states have fluctuated substantially over the past few years. 
  * Loan balances typically peak in December of each year, coinciding with holiday spending. 
  * From November to December 2023 alone, total debt grew by over half a million dollars - an increase of nearly 6%. 
  * Loan levels exhibit strong seasonal patterns and consistent year-over-year growth. 
  * Exploring opportunities to streamline lending and promote responsible personal finance practices has become increasingly important. 
	
### Loan Amount by Grade

<br/>

  * Borrowers with credit grades of A, B, and C, carried the highest total loan amounts, with Bgrade having $44,834,450 outstanding loans. This suggests that individuals with fair-to-good credit are utilizing loan programs more than those with lower credit scores.  
  * Borrowers with grades of E, F, and G had significantly lower total loan balances, with Ggrade having just $1,689,225 in debt.  
  * Analyzing lending patterns across credit tiers can provide insights for helping more customers improve their financial wellness through debt consolidation or programs tailored to their credit needs. 

### Loan Purpose Overview

<br/>

  * Small business, house, and debt consolidation loans accounted for the majority of loan purposes, with totals of 35,000, 35,000, and 32,000 respectively.  
  * Educational and car loans also represented sizable portions at 15,350 and 14,400.  
  * Other, credit card, and vacation loans had significantly lower totals.  
  * Exploring opportunities to refinance high-interest small business, housing, and debt consolidation loans could help borrowers reduce costs and better manage their finances in line with the presentation's objective. 

### State Comparison

  * The FILLED_MAP graph shows Total Loan Amount by State and provides valuable context to analyze differences in loan trends across geographic regions.  
  * This visual aids in accomplishing the section objective by highlighting for stakeholders how total debt levels vary between locations. 
  * Additional insights may help address the user’s goal of providing recommendations on better debt consolidation and lowering loan interest rates in specific states.  
  * By examining loan patterns between states uncovered in the data, opportunities could emerge to tailor financial wellness solutions and messaging to particular audiences.

## Recommendations

### Recommendations for State A
This section aims to provide targeted recommendations for a high-debt state. A graph showing forecasted loan trends for State A is needed to effectively visualize potential debt growth and identify opportunities for intervention. None of the available graphs appear to match this ideal visual or support the objective of recommending customized solutions. For example, with this forecast graph, the text could explain that projecting future loan amounts in State A reveals the need for programs tailored to its residents’ specific financial challenges.

### Recommendations for State B
This section aims to provide targeted recommendations for State B. A graph showing the loan purpose breakdown for residents in this state would help achieve the objective by visualizing how funds are currently allocated. None of the available visuals appear tailored to this need. For example, with this ideal visual, one could say that residents in State B would benefit from financial wellness courses focused on discretionary spending habits, as the graph indicates a pattern of high-interest debt in that category.
